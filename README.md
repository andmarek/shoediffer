# ShoeDiffer
Your one stop shop for more information about running shoes than you needed.

ShoeDiffer provides side-by-side running shoe-comparisons. Clear specs, fit visuals, and rotation ideas.

This app is currently in the MVP building phase! It does not have all of the features yet.

# Planned Features
- Compare 2+ shoes side-by-side (weight, stack, heel-to-toe drop, foam, pricing, etc.)
- Shoe overlays (think bikeinsights for bikes or eloshapes for mice) to compare fit
- Shoe rotation builder
